# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The AI Agent Orchestration Hub project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, supported versions, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.x   | ✅        |
| < 1.0   | ❌        |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Application Security
- **Environment Variable Protection**: All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Pydantic models
- **Non-root Container Execution**: Docker containers run as non-privileged user
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated security scanning with Bandit and Safety
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations for enhanced code safety

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal attack surface
- **Network Security**: Proper container networking and port management
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets or API keys in codebase
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring endpoints for system health verification

### API Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Request Validation**: All API inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure
- **Rate Limiting Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for rate limiting implementation

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Run security scans** before commits using pre-commit hooks
5. **Follow principle of least privilege** in all implementations

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
2. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
3. **Configure proper CORS** for your domain
4. **Monitor and log** all security-relevant events
5. **Keep container images updated** with latest security patches

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### ✅ DO
- **Report privately** first via GitHub Security Advisories
- **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
- **Include steps to reproduce** if possible
- **Suggest a fix** if you have one

### ❌ DON'T  
- **Don't open public issues** for security vulnerabilities
- **Don't disclose publicly** until we've had time to address it
- **Don't exploit** the vulnerability beyond what's needed for reporting

### 📧 Contact Information
- **Primary**: Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- **Alternative**: Create a private repository and invite the maintainers

### 🕒 Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Progress Update**: Within 1 week  
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (Critical: <48h, High: <1 week, Medium: <1 month)

## 🏷️ Vulnerability Severity

We follow the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for severity assessment:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | < 48 hours    |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    | < 1 week      |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9    | < 1 month     |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9    | Next release  |

## 🔧 Security Tools & Automation

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability checking
- **Docker Scout**: Container security scanning
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Dependency update automation

### CI/CD Security
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatic security checks
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous security validation
- **Container scanning**: Automated image vulnerability assessment
- **Dependency auditing**: Regular security updates
